Project back-to-n0t3

Portion of SM-N920C firmware to SM-G920F


We love XDA. We love to share things and make things better.

Me too. I love to apply things from other developers. But with proper credits.

I'd like to see other developers take commits from this repository and make things better. Contribute to the entire community.

But with proper credits.

'Open' does not mean 'no-respect'. Leave credits to original author and developer.

That's all I want.
